* The total number of retirement-eligible employees is 72,458.
* About 70% of the retirement-eligible employees have the titles of "Senior Engineer" or "Senior Staff". 
* The other 30% of the retirement-eligible employees have the titles of "Engineer", "Staff", "Technique Leader", "Assistant Engineer", or "Manager".
* There are 1,549 employees eligible for the mentorship program.

## Summary
Out of the 240,124 employees at Pewlett Hackard, there are 72,458 eligible for retirement. This analysis concludes that 30% of the workforce is eligible to retire. A query to find the current count of employees by title was completed to obtain these statistics.

There are 1,549 mentorship-eligible employees per the analysis. An additional query finds the employee counts per title in order to determine an lapses in the number of mentors available. If all mentorship-eligible employees accept the offer to work part-time as a mentor, there will still be a need for additional mentors. For example, with 454 "Senior Engineer" mentors and 25,916 potential retirements; there would be about 57 trainees for each mentor. Pewlett-Hackard does not have enough mentors for next generation of employees.
